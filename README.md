# cuda-python

cuda-python is a simple Python script ([main.py](./main.py) that using the [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) library will call a function inside a CUDA DLL file. This CUDA file has a very simple kernel to add two vectors using a CUDA enabled GPU.

This is a sample application I created to learn more about:

- CUDA development.
- NVIDIA Tools Extension (NVTX).
- Python and C interoperability.
